=begin
Hi, everyone! I have a few questions about the proper language used to describe programs on the written test. 
Each of my questions will use the following code snippet as an example/reference. 
=end
def fix(value)
  value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
  value
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

# check if line numbers required  (test.rb)
=begin
Firstly, is using line numbers to describe the location of things always necessary?
For example, 
=end

# the string object it references calls #upcase!


# referring to method parameters
