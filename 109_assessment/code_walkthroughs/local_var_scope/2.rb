a = 4

=begin
This code returns 4 and outputs nothing. It can be seen to demonstrate a few concepts;
namely, that there is a difference between return values and output, that
Ruby has implicit returns, and that local variable assignment specifically returns
the value assigned (4 to local variable `a` in this instance).
